# 🎯 **Maven Toy Data Analysis**

**A Complete SQL-Based Toy Store Data Analysis Project**

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project is part of **Mentorness Internship Task 2**, where I analyzed toy sales data for **Maven Toys** to uncover key business information related to store performance, product sales, and inventory management.

The dataset consists of **4 tables**: **Inventory**, **Products**, **Sales**, and **Stores**. Using **PostgreSQL**, I structured the data, wrote queries, and addressed **15 business questions** through SQL.

## 🛠️ Database Schema
The project uses PostgreSQL to model the dataset into a relational database. The following example illustrates the Products and Stores tables:

```sql
-- 🛠️ Products Table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    Product_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Product_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Product_Category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Product_Cost DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,  -- Adjusted precision
    Product_Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL   -- Adjusted precision
);

-- 🏬 Stores Table
CREATE TABLE Stores (
    Store_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Store_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Store_City VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Store_Location VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Store_Open_Date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Sales_Data Table
CREATE TABLE Sales_Data (
    Sale_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Sale_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Store_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Product_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Units INTEGER NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fk_store FOREIGN KEY (Store_ID) REFERENCES Stores(Store_ID),
    CONSTRAINT fk_product FOREIGN KEY (Product_ID) REFERENCES Products(Product_ID)
);

-- Inventory Table
CREATE TABLE Inventory (
    Store_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Product_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Stock_On_Hand INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (Store_ID, Product_ID),
    CONSTRAINT fk_store_inventory FOREIGN KEY (Store_ID) REFERENCES Stores(Store_ID),
    CONSTRAINT fk_product_inventory FOREIGN KEY (Product_ID) REFERENCES Products(Product_ID)
);
);
```
